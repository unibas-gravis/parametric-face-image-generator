WHAT'S NEW
----------
In the file 'example_config_controlled' located in data/config_files/example_config_controlled.json, you can specify an occlusion mode (third last row in the file). You can choose between:

### eyes
This mode retrieves the location of the eyes from the provided .tlms file and renders black circles over both eyes on the face.

### random-1
A hand hides the picture on a random place in a random orientation.

### random-2
A microphone hides the picture on a random place in a random orientation.

### random
This mode renders real-world occlusions in the image. They are in a random position, randomly scaled and randomly positioned.

### box
A rectangle filled with an arbitrary color hides the image.

### box-skinColor
Boxes filled with the color at the tip of the chin hide the image.

### box-whitnoise
Creates random rectangles on the face, filled with Gaussian white noise.

### box-\[0-100\]
Iteratively creates a box column-by-column that occludes the specified amount of pace pixels. It fills the rectangle with a random color.

### loop
Creates 20 images for each angle. Each with a different amount of occluded face region. Starting from 2%, it goes up to 40% by steps of 2%.

### texture
Fills a randomly placed box with a texture image.

OUTPUT
------

The software provides csv-files, rps-files, tlms-files, ground truth masks, images with occlusions and images without occlusions for both the `bfm` and the `face12` version of the Basel Face Model. If an occlusion gets rendered over a landmark, it gets disabled.
